# Aoe3-De-Project
want to help the devs improve the de ai, here is a quick mod that improves several aspects.

on AoE3DE>game>ai folder, rename aimain.xs, and add the one in the folder. use there is also a backup included just incase
ai will be more aggressive, use better units, make town centers and forts, better decks, and be more consistant. however i also introduced several bugs such as not building tradeposts.
